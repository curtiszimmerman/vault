## 0.3.0 (Unreleased)

BUG FIXES:

* cli: Fixed missing setup of client TLS certificates if no custom CA was provided

## 0.2.0 (July 13, 2015)

FEATURES:

 * **Key Rotation Support**: The `rotate` command can be used to rotate the
 master encryption key used to write data to the storage (physical) backend. [GH-277]
 * **Rekey Support**: Rekey can be used to rotate the master key and change
 the configuration of the unseal keys (number of shares, threshold required). [GH-277]
 * **New secret backend: `pki`**: Enable Vault to be a certificate authority and generate
   signed TLS certificates. [GH-310]
 * **New secret backend: `cassandra`**: Generate dynamic credentials for Cassandra [GH-363]
 * **New storage backend: `etcd`**: store physical data in etcd [GH-259] [GH-297]
 * **New storage backend: `s3`**: store physical data in S3. Does not support HA. [GH-242]
 * **New storage backend: `MySQL`**: store physical data in MySQL. Does not support HA. [GH-324]
 * `transit` secret backend supports derived keys for per-transaction unique keys [GH-399]

IMPROVEMENTS:

 * cli/auth: Enable `cert` method [GH-380]
 * cli/auth: read input from stdin [GH-250]
 * cli/read: Ability to read a single field from a secret [GH-257]
 * cli/write: Adding a force flag when no input required

 * core: audit log provides more useful information [GH-360]
 * core: graceful shutdown for faster HA failover
 * core: **change policy format** to use explicit globbing [GH-400]
 Any existing policy in Vault is automatically upgraded to avoid issues.
 All policy files must be updated for future writes. Adding the explicit glob
 character `*` to the path specification is all that is required.
 * core: policy merging to give deny highest precedence [GH-400]
 * credential/app-id: Protect against timing attack on app-id
 * credential/cert: Record the common name in the metadata [GH-342]
 * credential/ldap: Allow TLS verification to be disabled [GH-372]

 * credential/userpass: Protect against timing attack on password
 * credential/userpass: Use bcrypt for password matching
 * http: response codes improved to reflect error [GH-366]
 * http: the `sys/health` endpoint supports `?standbyok` to return 200 on standby [GH-389]
 * secret/app-id: Support deleting AppID and UserIDs [GH-200]
 * secret/consul: Fine grained lease control [GH-261]
 * secret/transit: Decouple raw key from key management endpoint [GH-355]
 * secret/transit: Upsert named key when encrypt is used [GH-355]
 * storage/zk: Support for HA configuration [GH-252]
 * storage/zk: Changing node representation. **Backwards incompatible**. [GH-416]

BUG FIXES:

 * audit/file: file removing TLS connection state
 * audit/syslog: fix removing TLS connection state
 * command/*: commands accepting `k=v` allow blank values
 * core: Allow building on FreeBSD [GH-365]
 * core: Fixed various panics when audit logging enabled
 * core: Lease renewal does not create redundant lease
 * core: fixed leases with negative duration [GH-354]
 * core: token renewal does not create child token
 * core: fixing panic when lease increment is null [GH-408]
 * credential/app-id: Salt the paths in storage backend to avoid information leak
 * credential/cert: Fixing client certificate not being requested
 * credential/cert: Fixing panic when no certificate match found [GH-361]
 * http: Accept PUT as POST for sys/auth
 * http: Accept PUT as POST for sys/mounts [GH-349]
 * http: Return 503 when sealed [GH-225]
 * secret/postgres: Username length is capped to exceeding limit
 * server: Do not panic if backend not configured [GH-222]
 * server: Explicitly check value of tls_diable [GH-201]
 * storage/zk: Fixed issues with version conflicts [GH-190]

MISC:

 * cli/path-help: renamed from `help` to avoid confusion

## 0.1.2 (May 11, 2015)

FEATURES:

  * **New physical backend: `zookeeper`**: store physical data in Zookeeper.
      HA not supported yet.
  * **New credential backend: `ldap`**: authenticate using LDAP credentials.

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * core: Auth backends can store internal data about auth creds
  * audit: display name for auth is shown in logs [GH-176]
  * command/*: `-insecure` has been renamed to `-tls-skip-verify` [GH-130]
  * command/*: `VAULT_TOKEN` overrides local stored auth [GH-162]
  * command/server: environment variables are copy-pastable
  * credential/app-id: hash of app and user ID are in metadata [GH-176]
  * http: HTTP API accepts `X-Vault-Token` as auth header [GH-124]
  * logical/*: Generate help output even if no synopsis specified

BUG FIXES:

  * core: login endpoints should never return secrets
  * core: Internal data should never be returned from core endpoints
  * core: defer barrier initialization to as late as possible to avoid
      error cases during init that corrupt data (no data loss)
  * core: guard against invalid init config earlier
  * audit/file: create file if it doesn't exist [GH-148]
  * command/*: ignore directories when traversing CA paths [GH-181]
  * credential/*: all policy mapping keys are case insensitive [GH-163]
  * physical/consul: Fixing path for locking so HA works in every case

SECURITY CHANGES:

  * physical/file: create the storge with 0600 permissions [GH-102]
  * token/disk: write the token to disk with 0600 perms

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * core: Very verbose error if mlock fails [GH-59]
  * command/*: On error with TLS oversized record, show more human-friendly
      error message. [GH-123]
  * command/read: `lease_renewable` is now outputed along with the secret
      to show whether it is renewable or not
  * command/server: Add configuration option to disable mlock
  * command/server: Disable mlock for dev mode so it works on more systems

BUG FIXES:

  * core: if token helper isn't absolute, prepend with path to Vault
      executable, not "vault" (which requires PATH) [GH-60]
  * core: Any "mapping" routes allow hyphens in keys [GH-119]
  * core: Validate `advertise_addr` is a valid URL with scheme [GH-106]
  * command/auth: Using an invalid token won't crash [GH-75]
  * credential/app-id: app and user IDs can have hyphens in keys [GH-119]
  * helper/password: import proper DLL for Windows to ask password [GH-83]
